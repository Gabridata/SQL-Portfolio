# SQL Portfolio

A curated collection of real-world business cases solved with SQL.  
Each case is designed to be clear for non-technical stakeholders while demonstrating strong analytical and technical skills.  
Although not limited to this domain, this portfolio shows a particular interest in challenges often seen in **tech startup** environments.

## What's Inside
For every case, you will find:
- **Business Problem** — described in plain language
- **Technical Solution** — implemented in SQL (PostgreSQL or BigQuery)
- **Executive Explanation** — why the solution works and its business impact

**Example Scenarios**
- Identifying top-performing products
- Reducing operational costs
- Predicting customer churn
- Measuring retention cohorts

> "I don't just write queries — I solve problems that drive decisions."

## For Non-Technical Viewers
- SQL files include clear comments that separate **BUSINESS LOGIC** and **PERFORMANCE** considerations.
